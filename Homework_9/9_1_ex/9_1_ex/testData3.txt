There is an old tradition,
A game we all can play:
It starts by getting liquored up and sharpening your blade.
You take a shot of whiskey and grab your knife and pray,
And spread apart your fingers,
And this is what you say:

Oh, I have all my fingers,
The knife goes chop, chop, chop...
If I miss the spaces in between, my fingers will come off.
And if I hit my fingers, the blood will soon come out,
But all the same I play this game, cause that is what it is all about!

No, you can not use a pencil!
You can not use a pen!
The only way is with a knife when danger is your friend.
Some may call it stupid,
And some may call it dumb,
But all the same we play this game, because it is so damn fun :)

Oh, I have all my fingers,
The knife goes chop, chop, chop...
If I miss the spaces in between my fingers will come off.
And if I hit my fingers, the blood will soon come out,
But all the same I play this game, cause that is what it is all about!

Oh, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop...
I am picking up the speed,
And if I hit my fingers, then my hand will start to bleed.
