There is an old tradition,
A game we all can play:
It starts by getting liquored up and sharpening your blade.
You take a shot of whiskey and grab your knife and pray,
And spread apart your fingers,
And this is what you say:

Oh, I have all my fingers,
The knife goes chop, chop, chop...
If I miss the spaces in between, my fingers will come off.
And if I hit my fingers, the blood will soon come out,
But all the same I play this game, cause that's what it's all about!

No, you can't use a pencil!
You can not use a pen!
The only way is with a knife when danger is your friend.
Some may call it stupid,
And some may call it dumb,
But all the same we play this game, because it's so damn fun :)

Oh, I have all my fingers,
The knife goes chop, chop, chop...
If I miss the spaces in between my fingers will come off.
And if I hit my fingers, the blood will soon come out,
But all the same I play this game, cause that's what it's all about!

Oh, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop...
I'm picking up the speed,
And if I hit my fingers, then my hand will start to bleed.
